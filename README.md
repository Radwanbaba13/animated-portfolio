# Animated Portfolio

## How I Worked on This Project

My approach to this project was methodical and focused on creating a dynamic experience. I started by sketching out the design and planning the animations to ensure they complemented the content effectively. My workflow involved:

- Creating and designing mockups on figma.
- Regular commits to track progress and changes.
- Utilization of modern web technologies like React and Vite for a seamless development process.
- Emphasis on interactive and visually appealing elements to make the portfolio stand out.

## How to Navigate This Project

- **src Folder**: Contains the main source code of the project including JavaScript and SCSS files.
- **public Folder**: Hosts static files like images and the main HTML file.
- **.eslintrc.cjs and package.json**: Configuration files that ensure code quality and manage dependencies respectively.

## Why I Built the Project This Way

I chose React and Vite for this project to leverage their fast rendering and hot module replacement features, which are crucial for an animated portfolio. The use of SCSS helped in writing more maintainable and scalable CSS. My focus was on creating an engaging user experience, hence the emphasis on animations and interactive elements. 

This approach highlights my technical skills and my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
